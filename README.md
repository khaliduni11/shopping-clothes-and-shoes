# shopping-clothes-and-shoes


This project is about shopping clothes and shoes.

This project is made by Nodejs, Reactjs, Mysql.

This project has few categories:
	-Authentication & Authorization
	-product
	-Addcart
	-Order & Delivery

->Authentication and authorization always keeps our application safe and to protect from other people who
aggressively want to use it. Authentication is the main role of the application if the user log in he/she allowed to make 
addcart and allows to make order and get delivery. If user is Editor he/she has permission to post anew Product, to update
old one, to delete unwanted product and has permission to make delivery and see all orders from the users. Admin is no
much different from Editor except that admin has power to change someone's role like to make him/her admin/editor but 
editor can't do this job.

-> Product is the items of the dresses that the websites sells and contains man, woman, child clothes and shoes. 

-> Addcart is used when user makes any demand of item/items and this is not allowed to see anyone else even admin/editor
and the only one can access is the user who have accessed that addcart.

-> Order and delivery is especial for admin/editor and there is no one can see it but the user can order get delivery 
with filling form of his/her address after that the admin/editor will see as sort of Ascending date and time and delivered
 becuase of avoiding confuse admin/editor to search who next, and the next one will be the top and delivered 
one will go down.
